# Homework 2: Supervised Learning


# Dataset: [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Pima+Indians+Diabetes)


# [Data Description:](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/pima-indians-diabetes/pima-indians-diabetes.names)


# Due: 2/8 (beginning of class)


# Format: ipython notebook submission on GitHub

- send link to your repository to Mason and Lema


## Instructions: answer the following questions with data and visuals

- Describe the content of the dataset and its goals
- Describe the features and formulate a hypothesis on which might be relevant in predicting diabetes
- Describe the missing/NULL values. Decide if you should impute or drop them and justify your choice.
- Come up with a benchmark for the minimum performance that an algorithm should have on this dataset
- What's the best performance you can get with kNN? Is kNN a good choice for this dataset?
- What's the best performance you can get with Naive Bayes? Is NB a good choice for this dataset?
- What's the best performance you can get with Logistic Regression? Is LR a good choice for this dataset?
- What's the best performance you can get with Random Forest? Is RF a good choice for this dataset?
- If you could only choose one, which classifer from the above that you already ran is best? How do you define best? (hint: could be prediction accuracy, running time, interpretability, etc)


## Note: you should know by now, but here is the order of importance:

- Your analysis (there is no "right" answer, only good and bad defense of it)
- Your visuals
- Your coding implementation
